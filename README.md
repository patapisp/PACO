paco - Contains python modules that implement the PACO algorithm and various IO and utility functions.
testData- Contains toy dataset used in testing.
output - Location of output files (or dirs? not sure yet...)

Run the Example.ipynb notebook to use.

fullpaco - Algorithm 1 from PACO paper
fastpaco - Algorithm 2 from PACO paper
fluxpaco - Algorithm 3 from PACO paper
paco - Generic functions shared between different algorithms

core - File IO
util - Rotations, coordinate transformations, model templates etc.
